##package needed:
1. dwi.internals2 (source codes included) 
2. quadprog, rgenoud, doParallel, cluster

##DiST codes:
1. dwi_basics.R: some basic functions 
2. dwi_fit.R: functions for direction estimation and smoothing
3. dwi_track.R: functions for fiber tracking  
(dwi_track_realdata.R: slightly modified version to fit the format of the real data output stored as in track.mat)
4. sim-curve-new.R: codes for simulation

##example scripts:
1. single_task_estimation.R: scripts for voxel-wise direction estimation
2. single_task_smoothing.R: scripts for direction smoothing
3. single_task_tracking.R: scripts for fiber tracking 
4. DiST_tracking_example_realdata.R: scripts for fiber tracking based on SN-lasso estimators on an ROI of a real DWI dataset (stored in track.mat)

##data:
1. track.mat: prepared fiber direction information based on SN-lasso estimators on an ROI of a real DWI dataset 
2. pre_estimation.Rdata: voxel-wise estimation of the simulation example (sim-curve-new.R), used as inputs for direction smoothing 
3. smoothing.Rdata: direction smoothing results of the simulation example, used as inputs for fiber tracking
4. tracking.Rdata: tracking results of the simulation example.
